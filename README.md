## Important concepts and notes

* The presenter covers a lot of ground building this to-do app. However, it is a nice demonstration of how everything we've learned to this point can come together to build powerful applications.
* Allow about double the time shown in the video to complete the tutorial on your own. (I had to stop and start the video to keep up with the typing.)
* (Time 16:42) App.js built slightly differently. (The current version of React does not build a class-based component as shown in the tutorial.) Change the text in your files to match what is shown on the screen.
* (Time 1:15:00) I ran into an issue with uuid. I had to change the import statement from import uuid from 'uuid'; to import {v4 as uuid} from 'uuid';
* I also had to change the uuid.v4() statements shown in the tutorial to uuid().
* Really watch your spelling and capitalization. It's very easy to make a typing error when referring back and forth from the tutorial to your own typing.
